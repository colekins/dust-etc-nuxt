  "body": "Today Post-Trash [shared](http://post-trash.com/news/2021/8/16/space-mountain-good-lies-post-trash-premiere) the lead song from the new Space Mountain record, *Celestial Force.* The album was recorded at home in Portland, Maine over the past year and is about the climate crisis, hopelessness, hopefulness, and human solidarity. The record can be preordered [here](https://spacemountain.bandcamp.com/album/celestial-force) ahead of its release on September 17th. 50% of all Bandcamp proceeds will be donated to the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/).\n\n> Lead single “Good Lies” is a song that reflects on the climate change catastrophe and the hope that humanity will come together to remedy the path we’ve set out for ourselves. A bit of hope mixed with lies that we tell ourselves in order to move on from day to day, Kinsler captures the feeling of helplessness and hope together in rationalizations over brushed snares, intricate acoustics and Henriksen’s delicate violin accompaniment. “Good Lies” has a front-porch fullness to it, with each piece carefully layered to create the bigger picture.\n>\n> *\\- Dan Goldin, [Post-Trash](http://post-trash.com/news/2021/8/16/space-mountain-good-lies-post-trash-premiere)*",
