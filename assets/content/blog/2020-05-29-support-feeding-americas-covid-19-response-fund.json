  "body": "All digital proceeds from the Space Mountain [bandcamp](http://spacemountain.bandcamp.com) will be donated directly to [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/)'s COVID-19 response fund for the foreseeable future. Feeding America is coordinating critical support for food banks across the country. Please consider donating [directly](https://bit.ly/390W4qo) if you don't need (or want) any Space Mountain music right now. \n\nP.S. *Ferry Lane* will probably be deleted from bandcamp at some point, so if you're curious about the dorm room album, now is the time to scoop it up for a few dollars.",
