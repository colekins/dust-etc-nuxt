  "body": "The latest Space Mountain record, *Togetherness* will be out both digitally and on cassette tape on March 8th, 2019. However, the record will be available to stream in full on its unofficial release date of March 7th as a birthday present for his mom. \n\n> If an answer is found, then it exists within the confessional yet outward looking tone, dwelling on personal fears not as some exercise in self-absorption but instead a channel for empathy and solidarity. Being human might be difficult, but that doesnâ€™t mean we should lose our humanity.\n>\n> \\- Jon Doyle, [Various Small Flames](https://varioussmallflames.co.uk/2019/01/10/space-mountain-cloud/)",
