          'If an answer is found, then it exists within the confessional yet outward looking tone, dwelling on personal fears not as some exercise in self-absorption but instead a channel for empathy and solidarity. Being human might be difficult, but that doesn’t mean we should lose our humanity.',

          'Summer Winter stems from the southern blues of Fahey’s earlier work. Split into two seasonal sides—“Summer” and “Winter,” four parts each—Atalay asks listeners to lean in closely to spot the subtle differences in how his guitar, all acoustic with no effects, translates hot and cool. The familiar ways to differentiate the seasons are present. “Summer” is often faster, louder, and has a warmer tone, while “Winter” is cooler in tone, quiet, and slower. The trap with these traditional fingerpicked methods is that one could make “Winter” less complex and less compelling. Atalay avoids this with a clever choice: He tweaks the weight of the notes.',

        body:
          'The sentiment veers from blunt reportage of the situation (“killed himself, hit the vein, got dragged to hell”) to acceptance (“I get that I couldn’t help this time”) to a kind of hopeful guilt, imagining that the right intervention might have been enough after all. The latter, which closes the song (and thus forms the lasting emotion), is not so much self-flagellation over chances missed, but rather a deep need to believe that people can be saved, that the things we can say or do are (or could be) enough to drag people from despair.',

        body:
          'Described as “a document of all the alienation, confusion, depression, and anger that comes from a big baby breaking out of his shell in a completely new and unknown environment“, the new record is introduced via the weird-but-wonderful slow-crawl of ‘someday’ – itself presented as an affective, annotated video piece. Making on good on those aforementioned influences, the song itself is strikingly poignant, sounding something like a crack of light in the most enveloping darkness.',
