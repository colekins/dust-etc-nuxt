      <h2>Kerem Atalay - <span class="album-title">Summer Winter</span></h2>

      <p class="news">
        Kerem Atalay is a self-taught guitarist who discovered American
        Primitive guitar while studying at University of Maryland and living in
        Takoma Park - where the style, and its creator, were both born. His work
        varies in structure and character, ranging from long-form compositions
        to brief impressionistic explorations. The pieces on
        <span class="italic">Summer Winter</span> tend to fall somewhere close
        to the middle of that spectrum and all draw inspiration from the seasons
        they are named after.

          "Summer Winter stems from the southern blues of Fahey’s earlier work.
          Split into two seasonal sides—“Summer” and “Winter,” four parts
          each—Atalay asks listeners to lean in closely to spot the subtle
          differences in how his guitar, all acoustic with no effects,
          translates hot and cool. The familiar ways to differentiate the
          seasons are present. “Summer” is often faster, louder, and has a
          warmer tone, while “Winter” is cooler in tone, quiet, and slower. The
          trap with these traditional fingerpicked methods is that one could
          make “Winter” less complex and less compelling. Atalay avoids this
          with a clever choice: He tweaks the weight of the notes."
